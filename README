Personal KISS repository
========================

This is my personal KISS repository,
I made it so anyone can install my 
builds of st,dwm,dmenu (or my small programs)
on Carbs Linux and KISS Linux


Add to your KISS Path
---------------------

In order to install packages in this repository,
you need to clone it and add it to your repository
path. It can be accomplished with,


	# Clone the repository
        -> git clone git://git.ckyln.com/kiss-repository /var/db/kiss/cem-repo
	
	# Now edit your /etc/profile.d/kiss_path.sh file
	# Add the path to the beginning if you want to

	# Adding to the beginning makes sure that if there
	# is the same package from another repository, it prioritizes
	# my package
	export KISS_PATH=/var/db/kiss/cem-repo/cem:/var/db/kiss/repo........
