The Z Filesystem on Carbs Linux
===============================

To run ZFS under Carbs, you need a kernel that supports modules. I personally
don't use any of the in-kernel modules, but I still have modules enabled for
this purpose. You can see my kernel configuration in this repository as well.

If you are building ZFS for a different kernel version, specify the kernel
version in the `KERNEL_VERSION` variable. Here is an example:

    KERNEL_VERSION=5.8.9 cpt b zfs

This will build for the target version, so you don't need to boot that kernel
in order to build the module.


Dependencies
------------

This package depends on 'libtirpc', but will probably link to more packages
on your system, such as util-linux, libressl, and zlib. Even though I have
tried linking all statically, it doesn't work.


Making ZFS datasets available on boot
-------------------------------------

I personally don't have my root under ZFS, you will need further reading if that
is your goal. I have two init scripts on '/etc/init' for mounting and unmounting
ZFS.


/etc/init/zfs.early-boot:

    modprobe zfs
    zpool import -a -f
    zfs load-key -a
    zfs mount -a


/etc/init/zfs.pre.shutdown:

    zfs umount -a
